I've had an idea about starting my personal tech blog for a long time and finally I had the motivation (and time) to set things up. The majority of the blog posts will concern my explorations in the field of software and information technology. Their main purpose is to act as a note for myself on how to setup, configure and do stuff. At the same time, I wish that someone will find these posts-to-be useful or maybe someone will learn from the posts. After all, I have found solutions to my problems from people's blogs plenty of times.

I hope you enjoy reading the blog and get some ideas for your own projects.
