Hello, I'm Tatu Sepp√§-Lassila from Finland. This blog is a place where I write about my experiences, thoughts, and ideas related to technology.

I work as a DevOps Consultant at [Polar Squad](https://polarsquad.com). Professionally my aspiration is building cloud infrastructures, which are automated, scalable, resilient, well-architected, and enable rapid software delivery. In addition, I want to see and help organizations to promote DevOps culture, encompassing shared responsibility, common goals, extensive collaboration, and supportive working environment.

Outside of work I like to stay active by playing football, running and going to the gym.
