Hello, I'm Tatu Sepp√§-Lassila from Finland. This blog is a place where I write about my experiences, thoughts, and ideas related to technology.

I work as a DevOps Consultant at [Polar Squad](https://polarsquad.com). Professionally my aspiration is building cloud infrastructures, which are automated, scalable, resilient, well-architected, and enable rapid software delivery. In addition, I want to see and help organizations to promote DevOps culture, encompassing shared responsibility, common goals, extensive collaboration, and supportive working environment.

Outside of work, I maintain an active lifestyle through various endurance sports, including running, cycling, adventure racing, and cross country skiing. When I'm not out testing my limits in the great outdoors, you can find me at the gym or unwinding with a good book.
